# SERPs-Launcher

The SERPs Launcher for F1 25 is an application which will install mods into your game directory for you! Simply set your game directory, drag and drop any downloaded mod onto the app, select it in the mod list, and launch F1 25!

All mods are supported
No need to worry about compatibility. The app can read any mod in a compressed archive (ZIP/RAR/7Z). Next to that, if a mod has multiple versions, it will show you all versions as separate variants of the same mod. Simply drag and drop any downloaded mod archive onto the app and enjoy!

The SERPs Launcher will also recognize if a mod needs the SERPs Base Files. Therefore when a mod that needs the Base Files is selected, it will automatically also select the Base Files.  Just don't forget to download, drag and drop the Base Files onto the app!

Also mods replace the same game files are recognized and seen as conflicting. To keep the game files safe, it will only allow for one of the conflicting mods to launch at the same time.

Clean game at all times
The app only backs up the original game files it will modify, NOT the whole game. This makes backing up original game files and restoring them super fast!

Game updates will run without any problems, because it automatically restores any backups the launcher made before installing your chosen mods, when you quit the game! And when you are not using the SERPs Launcher, your game will be clean to play any online game modes!
